## Examples
To see some examples, feel free to look through the several test entities GeckoLib adds.

Currently, we have:

* [Ascended Legfish](https://github.com/bernie-g/geckolib/blob/master/src/main/java/software/bernie/geckolib/example/entity/AscendedLegfishEntity.java) - Has two animation controllers, one to control it's size (has a growing animation), and one to control it's movement (has a walking, kicking, and punchwalking animation). The legfish grows to its bigger size when you punch it.

* [Stingray](https://github.com/bernie-g/geckolib/blob/master/src/main/java/software/bernie/geckolib/example/entity/StingrayTestEntity.java) - Has one animation controller, which changes animation based on the current downfall state. If it's raining it plays one animation, if it's not it plays a different one.

* [Flying Tigris](https://github.com/bernie-g/geckolib/blob/master/src/main/java/software/bernie/geckolib/example/entity/TigrisEntity.java) - Has two animation controllers, and showcases more features of AnimationBuilders.
