GeckoLib is an animation engine for Minecraft Mods, with support for complex 3D keyframe-based animations, 30+ easings, concurrent animation support, sound and particle keyframes, event keyframes, and more. Available for Forge and Fabric. 

## Installation
[![curseforge](https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/versions/388172.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/geckolib)
![Java CI with Gradle](https://github.com/bernie-g/geckolib/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Gradle/badge.svg?branch=1.15)

We use repsy.io for publishing as it provides easy access to releases and allows for javadocs in the jars (unlike curseforge).

Please see the [Getting Started guide](3.0.0) for detailed installation instructions per modding framework.

## Documentation
GeckoLib provides detailed documentation in the form of a [Wiki](3.0.0). GeckoLib is currently available for Forge 1.12, 1.15, 1.16 and Fabric 1.15 and 1.16.
